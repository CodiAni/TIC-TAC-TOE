# TIC-TAC-TOE


This is an overview of a multi-part series on implementing a self-learning Tic-Tac-Toe game. Tic-Tac-Toe, also called Naught and Crosses, as most people know, is a children's game played on a 3x3 board. Players take turns placing an 'X' or an 'O' in a cell. The first person to place 3 marks of the same type in a row, column or diagonal of the board wins.

The purpose of this series is to build a game of Tic-tac-toe, where a computer teaches itself to play the game. Additionally, we will build the same game using a variety of technologies and compare them.

The idea was to build a demo app that would help me demonstrate many of the techniques and tools . Since, we are going to be spending so much time on  this project , I felt that I might as well pick something fun: hence a game.
